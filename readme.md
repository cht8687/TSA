## Technology used

* React-native
* Redux

## Why do this?

React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. 

This $1.4 million app is an excellent topic for practising using the Redux structure to manage the React application.

This can be a new [To-Do mvc app](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) in Flux world to demostrate event based library e.g: Flux, Redux, Reflux, etc.


## Why do up and down?

The ultimate $1.4 million TSA app definitely has the copy right thing, we can't do left and right directions.


## Installation 

```
$ npm install 
```

Open in the iOS/Android project to compile and run.
